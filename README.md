# ExtraVM Deals: DDoS-Protected NVMe VPS, Lightning-Fast Performance, Global Locations

You know how some hosting companies feel like they're speaking a different language? Where you need a decoder ring just to understand what you're actually getting? ExtraVM isn't one of those. Founded back in 2014 in Texas, they had a pretty straightforward mission—build fast, secure VPS hosting that regular folks can actually afford and understand. No PhD in computer science required.

Here's the thing that caught my attention when I started digging into ExtraVM: they're not trying to be everything to everyone. They focus on what they're good at—NVMe-powered virtual private servers with solid DDoS protection across multiple global locations. And based on what actual users are saying on Trustpilot (where they've got a 5-star rating), they seem to be doing something right.

## What Makes ExtraVM Different from the Hosting Crowd

Walking through ExtraVM's offerings feels like browsing a well-organized hardware store instead of a chaotic flea market. Everything has its place, and you can actually find what you need without getting overwhelmed.

Their VPS plans run on modern AMD Ryzen 9, Ryzen 9950X, and EPYC processors paired with NVMe SSD storage. That's not just marketing jargon—it translates to servers that actually respond when you click something, instead of making you wait around wondering if your command went through. The kind of performance difference you feel in your bones when you're managing a busy website or game server at 2 AM.

The DDoS protection aspect deserves a mention too. It's built into most of their locations by default, not something you have to pay extra for or set up yourself. For anyone who's ever dealt with a DDoS attack (and if you haven't, consider yourself lucky), having that protection layer already in place is like having a really good insurance policy you hope you'll never need.

## The Global Footprint: Where ExtraVM Actually Lives

ExtraVM spreads its servers across some strategic spots around the globe. They've got locations in Dallas (their home base), Los Angeles, Miami, Secaucus (serving the NYC metro area), Amsterdam, Montreal, Singapore, Tokyo, and Sydney. That's not just throwing darts at a world map—each location serves specific regional needs.

Their Dallas facility runs on AS63018 network, which provides reliable connectivity across the US and to both coasts. Los Angeles sits perfectly for North America-to-Asia traffic. Singapore handles Southeast Asia beautifully. The variety means whether you're serving gamers in Australia or running a business app for European clients, there's probably a server close enough to make latency a non-issue.

What's particularly interesting is their hardware setup varies by location based on what makes sense. Los Angeles runs cutting-edge AMD Zen5 Ryzen 9950X or EPYC processors with up to 10Gbps network speeds. Miami offers up to 10Gbps on their ReliableSite network, perfect for Latin American connectivity. They're matching the hardware to the location's specific needs rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Breaking Down the VPS Plans: What You Actually Get

Let me walk you through their standard VPS offerings, because the devil's in the details here. ExtraVM structures their plans in a way that scales logically—you're not making weird jumps where doubling your price only gets you 20% more resources.

### Standard VPS Plans (Available in Most Locations)

| RAM | CPU Cores | NVMe Storage | Bandwidth | Network Speed | IPv4/IPv6 | DDoS Protection | Monthly Price | |
|-----|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---|
| 1GB | 1 Core | 15GB | 5TB | 1Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $4.50 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 2GB | 1 Core | 30GB | 5TB | 1-2.5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $8.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 3GB | 2 Cores | 45GB | 5TB | 1-2.5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $12.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 4GB | 2 Cores | 60GB | 10TB | 1-5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $14.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 6GB | 4 Cores | 90GB | 20TB | 1-5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $21.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 8GB | 4 Cores | 120GB | 20TB | 1-5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $28.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 16GB | 6 Cores | 240GB | 20TB | 1-5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $56.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |
| 32GB | 8 Cores | 480GB | 30TB | 1-5Gbps | 1 IPv4, /64 IPv6 | ✓ | $112.00 |  [Get Started](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) |

That pricing structure makes sense when you look at it. The entry-level plan at $4.50 is perfect for testing waters or running a small personal project. By the time you hit the 8GB plan at $28/month, you've got enough horsepower to run a decent-sized application or game server. And if you're running something that needs 32GB of RAM, you probably already know why you need it.

### Limited-Time Special Deals

ExtraVM runs promotional plans that are actually worth paying attention to. These aren't "limited time" offers that somehow last forever—they genuinely have limited stock and disappear when servers are full.

| Location | Processor | RAM | Storage | Bandwidth | Price | Stock Status |
|----------|-----------|-----|---------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Dallas, TX | 4 Cores Ryzen 9 | 16GB | 240GB NVMe | 20TB @ 1Gbps | $20.00/mo | Limited |
| Dallas, TX | 1 Core Ryzen 9 | 1.25GB | 14GB NVMe | 4TB @ 500Mbps | $1.30/mo | Limited |
| Dallas, TX | 3 Cores Ryzen 9 | 8GB | 120GB NVMe | 15TB @ 1Gbps | $8.20/mo | Limited |
| Dallas, TX | 2 Cores Ryzen 9 | 4GB | 60GB NVMe | 10TB @ 1Gbps | $5.00/mo | Limited |
| Miami, FL | 2 Cores Ryzen 9 | 10GB | 100GB NVMe | Unlimited @ 1Gbps | $17.00/mo | Limited |

The $1.30/month Dallas plan is kind of wild—that's legitimately less than a cup of coffee at most places. ExtraVM limits these to two per account, which makes sense. They're using these as loss leaders to bring in new customers and show off what their infrastructure can do.

## Current Promo Codes That Actually Work

Speaking of saving money, ExtraVM runs a few promotional codes that are active as of 2026. These aren't the usual "5% off if you sacrifice a chicken on the full moon" type deals—they're straightforward discounts.

**25SWITCH** - This code gives you 25% off your first month on VPS plans. It's their main switching incentive if you're coming from another provider. The math on this is simple: if you're looking at an $8 plan, you pay $6 the first month.

**GAME30** - Specifically for game server plans, this knocks 30% off your first month. Given that their Minecraft server hosting starts at around $6/month for 2GB RAM, getting 30% off makes it an even easier decision for trying them out.

**THR12** - This is a lifetime recurring discount code that shows up in some of their partner promotions. Unlike the first-month discounts, this one sticks around, though the percentage varies.

The beauty of these codes is they're not mutually exclusive with choosing special deal plans—though the codes typically work best on regular-priced plans rather than the already-discounted specials.

## What People Actually Say About Using ExtraVM

Numbers and specs only tell part of the story. What matters is whether the thing actually works when you need it to. ExtraVM maintains a 5-star rating on Trustpilot across 53 reviews, which is pretty unusual in the hosting industry where people love to complain (often for good reason).

Reading through user feedback, a few themes keep popping up. People consistently mention the customer support being responsive and actually helpful—not just copy-pasting from a knowledge base. One reviewer mentioned they've been a customer for over two years and "can guarantee ExtraVM is the best" specifically because of consistent good support experiences.

The technical performance gets praised too. Users running Minecraft servers note that switching to ExtraVM with their NVMe storage and Ryzen processors made a noticeable difference in gameplay smoothness. One admin mentioned their server runs particularly well after moving from another host, especially after optimizing with Paper Spigot.

On Reddit's r/feedthebeast community (which is notoriously picky about hosting), ExtraVM gets regular recommendations. Someone posted "a glowing review" noting that ExtraVM is the only host they've found with "great customer support, solid hardware, and decent prices" all in one package. For modded Minecraft specifically, which can be incredibly resource-intensive, that combination matters.

The criticism that does exist tends to be situation-specific rather than systemic issues. Some users note that during verification processes, setup isn't truly "instant"—though this is a security measure that makes sense. A few people have mentioned support response times varying depending on when you reach out, which is pretty normal for any company without 24/7 staffing.

## Beyond VPS: The Rest of ExtraVM's Ecosystem

While VPS hosting is their bread and butter, ExtraVM expanded into related services that use the same infrastructure advantages.

Their **game server hosting** runs on the same fast Ryzen and Intel hardware with NVMe storage. Minecraft server hosting starts at $6/month for 2GB RAM with unlimited storage and full support for any server software—Spigot, Paper, Forge, whatever you need. They also support other games through their platform, all with included DDoS protection and instant setup through the Pterodactyl control panel.

**Web hosting** is the newest addition, starting at $3.99/month. It uses SPanel control panel (instead of the more common cPanel), LiteSpeed web server, and NVMe storage. The interesting bit here is they include unlimited bandwidth even on basic plans. They offer plans in both Dallas and Germany (Falkenstein), giving you options for serving North American or European audiences primarily.

The web hosting particularly stands out because it includes features like unlimited email accounts, MySQL/PostgreSQL databases, and automatic WordPress installation. For $3.99/month, that's pretty comprehensive. They also run $20/year promotional web hosting plans occasionally, which is borderline ridiculous pricing for what you get.

## The Technical Stuff That Actually Matters

Let me get into some specifics for folks who care about the nuts and bolts.

**Operating System Support**: ExtraVM provides one-click cloud-init installations for most major Linux distributions—Debian, Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, CentOS, Rocky Linux. They also support Windows and BSD systems. If you need something more obscure, you can manually install from an ISO through their control panel by providing a direct HTTPS download link.

**Network Infrastructure**: The network quality varies by location but generally ranges from solid to excellent. Dallas operates on their AS63018 network with DDoS mitigation included. Los Angeles gets up to 10Gbps ports on certain plans. Amsterdam sits in Digital Realty's facility with excellent European routing. Each location has its own looking glass so you can test ping, routing, and download speeds before committing.

**DDoS Protection**: Most locations include DDoS protection by default, with capacity and mitigation capabilities varying by location. Some locations like Montreal even provide access to OVH's special Network Firewall and Game Firewall for additional protection layers. This isn't the kind of basic filtering that just blocks obvious attacks—it's multi-layered protection that can handle substantial L4 attacks.

**Storage Architecture**: All VPS plans use NVMe SSD storage in RAID configurations on enterprise-grade hardware. For anyone who's suffered through slow SATA SSD or (worse) spinning disk hosting, the performance difference is immediately noticeable. Database queries that took seconds complete in milliseconds. Page loads that stuttered become snappy.

**Virtualization**: They use KVM virtualization with nested virtualization enabled, which means you can run Docker, Kubernetes, or even other VMs inside your VPS if needed. That flexibility matters for development environments or complex application stacks.

**IP Addresses**: Every plan includes 1 IPv4 address and a /64 IPv6 subnet by default. You can manage reverse DNS (rDNS/PTR records) through their VM control panel, which is essential for running mail servers or anything that needs clean IP reputation.

## The Support Structure: What Happens When Things Break

ExtraVM makes a point of providing US-based support with no outsourcing and explicitly no AI-based responses. In an era where most hosting companies have automated everything possible, this is refreshing.

Their support primarily operates through email at sales@extravm.com, with most responses coming within a few hours. They also offer live chat during business hours. The knowledge base covers common questions about VPS management, DDoS protection setup, operating system installation, and troubleshooting.

What I found interesting in user reviews is people specifically mention getting helpful responses from actual techs who understand the systems. One reviewer noted that when they had an issue with a modded Minecraft server, support didn't just say "we don't support that"—they helped troubleshoot the problem even though it wasn't directly ExtraVM's fault.

The 5-day money-back guarantee provides a safety net for testing. If the performance doesn't meet your needs or you just don't like how things work, you can bail out without losing much money. Given that most VPS setups activate instantly (barring identity verification requirements), you can genuinely test the service within that window.

## Who ExtraVM Actually Makes Sense For

Not every hosting provider works for everyone, and ExtraVM has a sweet spot.

They're excellent for anyone running applications that need consistent performance—game servers, development environments, production applications with moderate traffic, personal projects that you care about. The NVMe storage and modern CPUs mean you're not constantly waiting for disk I/O or CPU cycles.

The global location spread makes them good for international projects. If you're serving users in Singapore and Europe, you can potentially run VPS instances in both regions and load balance between them. The pricing makes this actually feasible without breaking the bank.

For Minecraft server operators specifically, ExtraVM has built a strong reputation. The combination of fast CPUs, NVMe storage, and included DDoS protection addresses the three main pain points of Minecraft hosting—lag, long world saves, and griefing attacks.

Web developers and agencies could use the VPS plans for hosting client sites or running development servers. The ability to snapshot, clone, and manage multiple VPS instances makes it practical for managing multiple projects.

Where ExtraVM might not fit is if you need extensive customization of hardware resources. They don't offer custom CPU allocations or resource mixes outside their standard plans. If you need exactly 6.5GB of RAM with 3.2 CPU cores, you're out of luck—you'd need to pick the plan that covers your maximum requirement.

Similarly, if you need additional IPv4 addresses for your VPS (common for some network setups or running multiple SSL certificates), ExtraVM doesn't provide extras for their standard or special plans. That's a hard limitation worth knowing upfront.

## The Price Match Promise and What It Means

ExtraVM offers price matching for customers switching from other providers. This isn't advertised loudly, but it exists. The catch is your current service needs to meet their guidelines in terms of hardware quality and configuration.

The practical application here is if you're running a VPS elsewhere that costs $15/month for 4GB RAM with similar specs, ExtraVM might match or beat that price to win your business. You'd need to provide proof of your current service and pricing, and they evaluate whether the match makes sense for their business model.

This works best when switching from premium providers where you're paying for brand name as much as service. Moving from budget providers might not qualify since ExtraVM's regular pricing is already competitive in that tier.

## Making the Decision: Is ExtraVM Right for You?

After digging through specs, pricing, reviews, and actual infrastructure details, ExtraVM comes across as a solid middle-ground provider that punches above its weight class.

They're not trying to be the absolute cheapest option (though some of their promotional plans come close). They're not positioning themselves as enterprise-grade infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies either. They sit in this sweet spot of providing genuinely good hardware, solid network connectivity, included security features, and responsive support at prices that work for individuals and small-to-medium businesses.

The NVMe storage across all plans isn't just a checkbox feature—it makes a real performance difference for most applications. The DDoS protection being included rather than an add-on means you're not scrambling to add security when you suddenly need it. The variety of global locations provides actual options rather than "technically multi-region" setups where only one location really works well.

The transparent pricing helps too. What you see is what you pay, without surprise fees showing up at renewal time. The promotional codes provide legitimate discounts without requiring you to navigate a maze of restrictions and fine print.

If you're currently wrestling with slow hosting, inconsistent performance, or support that reads like automated responses from a neural network trained on corporate speak, ExtraVM might be worth a look. Their 5-day refund period means the risk of trying them out is pretty minimal—basically the cost of a decent lunch if it doesn't work out.

The hosting market is crowded with providers making big promises, but sometimes what you really need is solid infrastructure that works consistently without drama. From what users report and what the specs indicate, that's what ExtraVM delivers. Not flashy, not revolutionary—just reliable hosting that does what it's supposed to do, which turns out to be exactly what most people actually need.
